# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What are we doing in this repository ? 
- Wer're learning Data Structures and Algorithms with example problems in Python.
- We're solving complex coding interview questions from (Apple , Tesle , Google, etc.)
### Okay but what is Data Structures and Algorithms ?
- A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.

# Let's Start ! 

### What is Big O Notation ? 
- Big O Notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms.
- It calculates the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows.
- Big O Notation in Data Structure describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime.

In other words , Big O Notation calculates the worst scenario of  an algorithm's time  complexity .
